Clean up Ubuntu nvidia softwares previous installation 
(a) Open a terminal window and type the following three commands to get rid of any NVIDIA/CUDA packages you may already have installed:

sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda*
sudo apt remove --autoremove nvidia-cuda-toolkit
sudo apt remove --autoremove nvidia-*

(b) Purge any remaining NVIDIA configuration files and the associated dependencies that they may have been installed with.

sudo apt-get purge nvidia*
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get autoclean

(c) Remove any existing CUDA folders you may have in /usr/local/
This threw me for a loop the first several times I tried installing CUDA. There shouldn’t be any folders with the name “cuda” or “cuda-anything” in usr/local/ at this point!

sudo rm -rf /usr/local/cuda*
